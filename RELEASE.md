## Emergency Procedures

### üö® **Hotfix Releases**

If a critical bug is discovered post-release:

- [ ] **Assessment**
  - [ ] Evaluate severity and impact
  - [ ] Determine if hotfix release is warranted
  - [ ] Document the issue thoroughly
- [ ] **Rapid Response**
  - [ ] Create hotfix branch from release tag
  - [ ] Apply minimal fix with focused testing
  - [ ] Skip non-critical checklist items
  - [ ] Release with patch version bump
  - [ ] Clearly communicate the hotfix to users

### üìã **Rollback Plan**

If major issues are discovered:

- [ ] **Assessment**
  - [ ] Document the issue and impact
  - [ ] Decide if rollback is necessary
- [ ] **Rollback Actions**
  - [ ] Mark GitHub release as pre-release or draft
  - [ ] Consider yanking crates.io version if severe
  - [ ] Communicate clearly to users
  - [ ] Plan corrective release

## Required Secrets & Access

Ensure you have access to:

- [ ] **GitHub**: Repository admin access for releases
- [ ] **Crates.io**: Publishing permissions (`CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`)
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Access to GitHub Actions and secrets

## Version-Specific Notes

### Current Release (v0.2.0 example)
- New CI/CD pipeline - verify all platforms build
- ASCII logo changes - test visual consistency
- Enhanced shell UX - verify exit instructions work

### Common Gotchas
- **Windows support**: Fuzzy search (`skim`) is disabled on Windows
- **Cross-compilation**: ARM64 builds require proper toolchain setup  
- **Encryption**: Test with both new and existing encrypted notebooks
- **Migration**: Verify legacy `entries/` to `notebooks/default/` migration
